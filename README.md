# Arduino-Alarm_System
A simple alarm system developed for Arduino

## Info
This was a school project issued to us.

## How it works
This project has 1 button that powers on the circuit and has a led to indicate that it is on. The alarm has a small buzzer that will sound off if there is any activity detected by the PIR sensor. If no more activity is detected the buzzer will stop and it will start looking for activity again.
